General Class Library (GCL)
===========================

sqlWriter
---------------
This selection of classes allows SQL queries to be easily assembled. The mapped part is user generated map files can be loaded
to map a programmed database application to the user generated (or pre-existing) tables.

A typical code section would be
SQLWriter sqlQuery.select("employees.*").from(employees);
std::string sqlString = sqlQuery.string();
or
std::stirng sqlString = static_cast<std::string>(sqlQuery);

The value of sqlString is then
SELECT employees.* FROM employees;


PluginManager
-------------
Only one instance of the plugin manager class should be used in an application. This class contains data that should be shared over
the entire application.

The class is multi-thread safe.
