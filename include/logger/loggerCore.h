// OVERVIEW:            This file implements a logging class to be used to log messages to file.
//                      The class has been designed as a lightweight easy to use class.
//
// CLASSES INCLUDED:    CLogger
//
// HISTORY:             2024-02-05 GGB - Rewrite to a flexible approach to enable additional functionality to be added.
//                      2022-06-09 GGB - Replace macros TRACENETER and TRACEEXIT with functions.
//                      2019-10-22 GGB - Changed Boost::thread to std::thread
//                      2018-08-12 GGB - gnuCash-pud debugging and release.
//                      2015-09-22 GGB - AIRDAS 2015.09 release
//                      2014-07-20 GGB - Development of class for "Observatory Weather System - Service"

  /// @page page1 Logger
  /// @tableofcontents
  /// The logger classes provide a lightweight logging mechanism for logging errors, debug and diagnostic information, as well
  /// as tracing code execution.
  /// @section sec1 Overview
  /// The logger implementation consists of a core class CLogger, sink classes and a message class.
  /// The logger is multi-threaded allowing the messages to be logged and output asynchronously.
  /// Logger sinks are used to output the log information. Standard sinks are provided for streams (eg, std::cout), files and
  /// also for a Qt text edit control.Any number of sinks can be registered with the logger core.
  /// When a messsage is logged, the core writes the message to all the sinks in turn. This is done on a parallel thread to enable
  /// the main application to continue executing.
  /// @section sec2 Severity
  /// Each message has a severity assigned. The severity determines if the message will be captured by any specific sink. Thus it
  /// is possible to have a sink, sinking to an error file for critical and error messages, and another sink, sinking to a log
  /// file for all other messages except debug and trace messages.
  /// The major components of the logger are
  /// CLogger - The core logging component. One instance is created for each type of log required.
  /// Records - Records are logging records. The record contains the data to be logged. Records are created and added to the log
  ///           queue
  /// Queue - The queue that ensures that the messages are processed in the correct order. The default queue is a simple FIFO queue,
  ///         but it is possible to create queues that process in different orders. (Priority, LIFO, Alarm))
  /// Filter - Filters manage which records are processed and which records are simply discarded. The filter converts the
  ///          information in the record into an output string/message.
  /// Sinks - Sinks present or store the information.
  /// A logging system then consists of the following:
  /// A single CLogger that manages all the records. It contains a single queue and multiple sinks.
  /// Each sink has an filter. The filter converts to records to strings for output/storage by the sink.
